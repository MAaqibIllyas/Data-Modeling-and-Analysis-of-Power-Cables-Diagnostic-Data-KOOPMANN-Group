## Data Modeling | ETL piepline | Data Insertion | Data Analysis & Visualization | Predictive Maintenance

### Task

The main goal is to model the diagnostic and monitoring data of the Power cables in a structured way for analysis and monitoring purpose using
the relational database schema. The data would be stored in a relational database, where it can be further used for statistical analysis, reporting, and visualization. The Predictive Maintenance of Power cables is to be done on the basis of analysis.

This project involves the following steps:

* Conversion of unstructured tabular data of Test reports into structured data format.

* Development of Entity-Relationship model defining the structure of the data.

* Configuration of relational Database and creation of tables.

* Insertion of data from the excel files into the Database.

* Exploration and Statistical Analysis of data through the Database.

* Visualization of insights for the stakeholders to take the right decisions about Predictive Maintenance.
